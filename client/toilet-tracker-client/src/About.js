        In urban areas, especially in densely populated locations or during
        outdoor events, finding a clean, accessible public restroom can be a
        challenging experience. The absence of real-time information about
        restroom locations, cleanliness, amenities, and availability leads to
        confusion, inconvenience, and frustration among the public.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a lack of centralized, easily accessible, and user-friendly
        solutions that allow individuals to quickly locate public restrooms,
        assess their cleanliness, and find relevant amenities. This problem is
        especially evident for people with disabilities, families with children,
        and tourists who may need specific restroom facilities while on the go.
